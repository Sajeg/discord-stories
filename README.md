# Used Software

I used the Python library [TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) for realistic Text to speech results.  

Insted of the official ChatGPT API I used [Unlimited GPT](https://github.com/Sxvxgee/UnlimitedGPT), however I [forked](https://github.com/Sajeg/UnlimitedGPT) it to update the chromedrivers to work with newer version. At this moment it isn't merged, so I recommend using my fork.  

The reason, why I used UnlimitedGPT is simple. I don't have a credit card and not much money, so I needed to use something else.

For interacting with Discord I used [py-cord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord)
